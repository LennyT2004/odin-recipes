	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>
		Katsudon is a delectable Japanese dish renowned for its harmonious blend of flavors and textures.
		This comforting meal centers around a crispy deep-fried pork cutlet, or "tonkatsu," served atop a bed of steamed rice.
		The cutlet is complemented by a savory and slightly sweet broth made with ingredients like soy sauce, mirin, and dashi.
		To complete the ensemble, the dish is crowned with a soft, beaten egg that's gently cooked in the residual heat.
		The result is a delightful amalgamation of crunchy, succulent pork, velvety egg, and umami-laden broth, creating a satisfying and hearty culinary experience.
