	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>
		A Smash Burger is a culinary delight that embodies simplicity and flavor in perfect harmony.
		Crafted with precision, this burger starts with a high-quality ground beef patty expertly seasoned
		and smashed onto a hot griddle. The result is a thin, crispy crust that seals in juiciness.
		Topped with a melty slice of cheese, fresh lettuce, tomatoes, and condiments,
		the Smash Burger is a sensory explosion, delivering a rich umami taste with each bite.
		The marriage of textures, from the crunch of the crust to the tenderness of the beef, creates
		an unforgettable dining experience, making the Smash Burger a beloved classic in the world of gastronomy.
